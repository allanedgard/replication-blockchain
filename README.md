# Replication-Blockchain

The Byzantine consensus is a widely used approach for achieve replication even in presence of malicious processes, but it does not scale on large scenarios. Distributed consensus based on mechanisms as Proof of Work, introduced by Bitcoin, allow us to deploy a relaxed version of the traditional Byzantine consensus, that may be useful for applications that requires only eventual consistency. This project will exercise replication approaches through blockchain mechanism for eventual consistency replication.
